Patience
Twenty love-sick maidens we,Love-sick all against our will.
 Twenty years hence we shall beTwenty love-sick maidens still!
 Twenty love-sick maidens we,
And we die for love of thee!
Love feeds on hope, they say, or love will die;
Ah, miserie!
Yet my love lives, although no hope have I!
Ah, miserie!
Alas, poor heart, go hide thyself away,
To weeping concords tune thy roundelay!
Ah, miserie!
All our love is all for one,
Yet that love he heedeth not,
He is coy and cares for none,
Sad and sorry is our lot!
Ah, miserie!
Go, breaking heart,
Go, dream of love requited!
Go, foolish heart,
Go, dream of lovers plighted;
Go, madcap heart,
Go, dream of never waking;
And in thy dream
Forget that thou art breaking!
Ah, miserie!
Forget that thou art breaking!
Twenty love-sick maidens we,Love-sick all against our will.
 Twenty years hence we shall beTwenty love-sick maidens still!
 Twenty love-sick maidens we,
And we die for love of thee!

Still brooding on their mad infatuation!
I thank thee, Love, thou comest not to me!
Far happier I, free from thy ministration,
Than dukes or duchesses who love can be!

I cannot tell what this love may be
That cometh to all but not to me.
It cannot be kind, as they'd imply,
Or why do these ladies sigh?
It cannot be joy and rapture deep,
Or why do these gentle ladies weep?
It cannot be blissful as 'tis said,
Or why are their eyes so wondrous red?
Though everywhere true love I see
A-coming to all, but not to me,
I cannot tell what this love may be!
For I am blithe and I am gay,
While they sit sighing night and day.
For I am blithe and I am gay,^Yes, she is blithe and she is gay,
While they sit sighing night and day.^Yes, she is blithe and she is gay
Think of the gulf 'twixt them and me,^Yes, she is blithe and she is gay
Fal la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
and miserie!^Ah,miserie!

If love is a thorn, they show no wit
Who foolishly hug and foster it.
If love is a weed, how simple they
Who gather it, day by day!
If love is a nettle that makes you smart,
Then why do you wear it next your heart?
And if it be none of these, say I,
Ah, why do you sit and sob and sigh?
Though ev'rywhere true love I see
A-coming to all, but not to me,
I cannot tell what this love may be!
For I am blithe and I am gay,
While they sit sighing night and day.
For I am blithe and I am gay,^Yes, she is blithe and she is gay,
Think of the gulf 'twixt them and me,^Yes, she is blithe and she is gay
Think of the gulf 'twixt them and me,^Yes, she is blithe and she is gay
Fal la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
and miserie!^Ah,miserie!

The soldiers of our Queen
Are linked in friendly tether;
Upon the battle scene
They fight the foe together.
There ev'ry mother's son
Prepared to fight and fall is;
The enemy of one
The enemy of all is!
If you want a receipt for that popular mystery,
Known to the world as a Heavy Dragoon,
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Take all the remarkable people in history,
Rattle them off to a popular tune.
The pluck of Lord Nelson on board of the Victory 
Genius of Bismarck devising a plan 
The humour of Fielding (which sounds contradictory) 
Coolness of Paget about to trepan 
The science of Jullien, the eminent musico 
Wit of Macaulay, who wrote of Queen Anne 
The pathos of Paddy, as rendered by Boucicault 
Style of the Bishop of Sodor and Man 
The dash of a D'Orsay, divested of quackery 
Narrative powers of Dickens and Thackeray 
Victor Emmanuel  peak-haunting Peveril 
Thomas Aquinas, and Doctor Sacheverell 
Tupper and Tennyson  Daniel Defoe 
Anthony Trollope and Mister Guizot! Ah!
Take of these elements all that is fusible,
Melt them all down in a pipkin or crucible,
Set them to simmer, and take off the scum,
And a Heavy Dragoon is the residuum!
Yes! yes! yes! yes!
A Heavy Dragoon is the residuum!
If you want a receipt for this soldier-like paragon,
Get at the wealth of the Czar (if you can) 
The family pride of a Spaniard from Aragon 
Force of Mephisto pronouncing a ban 
A smack of Lord Waterford, reckless and rollicky 
Swagger of Roderick, heading his clan 
The keen penetration of Paddington Pollaky 
Grace of an Odalisque on a divan 
The genius strategic of Caesar or Hannibal 
Skill of Sir Garnet in thrashing a cannibal 
Flavour of Hamlet  the Stranger, a touch of him 
Little of Manfred (but not very much of him) 
Beadle of Burlington  Richardson's show 
Mister Micawber and Madame Tussaud! Ah!
Take of these elements all that is fusible,
Melt them all down in a pipkin or crucible,
Set them to simmer, and take off the scum,
And a Heavy Dragoon is the residuum!
Yes! yes! yes! yes!
A Heavy Dragoon is the residuum!

In a doleful train
Two and two we walk all day 
For we love in vain!
None so sorrowful as they
Who can only sigh and say,
Woe is me, alackaday!
Now is not this ridiculous, and is not this preposterous?
A thorough-paced absurdity  explain it if you can.
Instead of rushing eagerly to cherish us and foster us,
They all prefer this melancholy literary man.
Instead of slyly peering at us,
Casting looks endearing at us,
Blushing at us, flushing at us, flirting with a fan;
They're actually sneering at us, fleering at us, jeering at us!
Pretty sort of treatment for a military man!
They're actually sneering at us, fleering at us, jeering at us!
Pretty sort of treatment for a military man!
Mystic poet, hear our prayer,
Twenty love-sick maidens we 
Young and wealthy, dark and fair,
All of county family.
And we die for love of thee 
Twenty love-sick maidens we!
Yes, we die for love of thee 
Though my book I seem to scan
In a rapt ecstatic way,
Like a literary man
Who despises female clay,
I hear plainly all they say,
Twenty love-sick maidens they!
He hears plainly, all they say,
Twenty love-sick maidens they!
Though so excellently wise,
For a moment mortal be.
Deign to raise thy purple eyes
From thy heart-drawn poesy.
Twenty lovesick maidens see 
Each is kneeling on her knee!
Though, as I remarked before,
Any one convinced would be
That some transcendental lore
Is monopolizing me,
Round the corner I can see
Each is kneeling on her knee!
Round the corner he can see
Each is kneeling on her knee!
Now is not this ridiculous,
and is not this preposterous?
A thorough-paced absurdity - ridiculous!
preposterous! Explain it if you can.
In a doleful train,^Now is not this ridiculous
Two and two we walk all day,^and is not this preposterous

None so sorrowful as they^to cherish us and foster us,

When I first put this uniform on,
I said, as I looked in the glass,
"It's one to a million
That any civilian
My figure and form will surpass.
Gold lace has a charm for the fair,
And I've plenty of that, and to spare,
While a lover's professions,
When uttered in Hessians,
Are eloquent ev'rywhere!"
A fact that I counted upon,
When I first put this uniform on!
By a simple coincidence, few
Could ever have counted upon,
The same thing occurred to me,
When I first put this uniform on!
I said, when I first put it on,
"It is plain to the veriest dunce,
That every beauty
Will feel it her duty
To yield to its glamour at once.
They will see that I'm freely gold-laced
In a uniform handsome and chaste" 
But the peripatetics
Of long-haired aesthetics
Are very much more to their taste 
Which I never counted upon,
When I first put this uniform on!
By a simple coincidence, few
Could ever have reckoned upon,
I didn't anticipate that,
When I first put this uniform on!

Am I alone,
And unobserved? I am!
Then let me own
I'm an aesthetic sham!
This air severe
Is but a mere^Veneer!
This cynic smile
Is but a wile^Of guile!
This costume chaste
Is but good taste^Misplaced!
Let me confess!
A languid love for Lilies does not blight me!
Lank limbs and haggard cheeks do not delight me!
I do not care for dirty greens
By any means.
I do not long for all one sees
That's Japanese.
I am not fond of uttering platitudes
In stained-glass attitudes.
In short, my mediaevalism's affectation,
Born of a morbid love of admiration!
If you're anxious for to shine in the high^aesthetic line as a man of culture rare,
You must get up all the germs of the transcendental^terms, and plant them ev'rywhere.
You must lie upon the daisies and discourse^in novel phrases of your complicated state of mind,
The meaning doesn't matter if it's only^idle chatter of a transcendental kind.
And ev'ry one will say,
As you walk your mystic way,
"If this young man expresses himself in terms too deep for me,
Why, what a very singularly deep young man^this deep young man must be!"
Be eloquent in praise of the very dull old days^which have long since passed away,
And convince 'em, if you can, that the reign of^good Queen Anne was Culture's palmiest day.
Of course you will pooh-pooh whatever's fresh and new,^and declare it's crude and mean,
For Art stopped short in the cultivated court of^the Empress Josephine.
And ev'ryone will say,
As you walk your mystic way,
"If that's not good enough for him which is good enough for me,
Why, what a very cultivated kind of youth this kind of youth must be!"
Then a sentimental passion of a vegetable fashion^must excite your languid spleen,
An attachment a la Plato for a bashful young potato,^or a not-too-French French bean!
Though the Philistines may jostle, you will rank^as an apostle in the high aesthetic band,
If you walk down Piccadilly with a poppy or^a lily in your mediaeval hand.
And ev'ryone will say,
As you walk your flow'ry way,
"If he's content with a vegetable love which^would certainly not suit me,
Why, what a most particularly pure young man^this pure young man must be!"

Long years ago  fourteen, maybe,
When but a tiny babe of four,
Another baby played with me,
My elder by a year or more.
A little child of beauty rare,
With marv'lous eyes and wondrous hair,
Who, in my child-eyes, seemed to me
All that a little child should be!
Ah, how we loved, that child and I!
How pure our baby joy!
How true our love  and, by the bye,
He was a little boy!
Ah, old, old tale of Cupid's touch!
I thought as much  I thought as much!
He was a little boy!
Pray don't misconstrue what I say 
Remember, pray - remember, pray,
He was a little boy!
No doubt! Yet, spite of all your pains,
The interesting fact remains 
He was a little boy!
Ah, yes, in spite of all my pains^No doubt! yet, spit of all your pains,
The interesting fact remains
He was a little boy!
He was a little boy!

Prithee, pretty maiden  prithee, tell me true,
(Hey, but I'm doleful, willow willow waly!)
Have you e'er a lover a-dangling after you?
Hey willow waly O!
I would fain discover
If you have a lover!
Hey willow waly O!
Gentle sir, my heart is frolicsome and free 
(Hey, but he's doleful, willow willow waly!)
Nobody I care for comes a-courting me 
Hey willow waly O!
Nobody I care for
Comes a-courting  therefore,
Hey willow waly O!
Prithee, pretty maiden, will you marry me?
(Hey, but I'm hopeful, willow willow waly!)
I may say, at once, I'm a man of propertee 
Hey willow waly O!
Money, I despise it,
Many people prize it,
Hey willow waly O!
Gentle sir, although to marry I design 
(Hey, but he's hopeful, willow willow waly!)
As yet I do not know you, and so I must decline.
Hey willow waly O!
To other maidens go you 
As yet I do not know you,
Hey willow waly O!

Though to marry you would very selfish be 
Hey, but I'm doleful  willow willow waly!
You may, all the same, continue loving me 
Hey willow waly O!
All the world ignoring,
You'll/I'll go on adoring 
Hey, willow waly O!

Let the merry cymbals sound,
Gaily pipe Pandaean pleasure,
With a Daphnephoric bound
Tread a gay but classic measure,
Tread a gay but classic measure.
Ev'ry heart with hope is beating,
For, at this exciting meeting
Fickle Fortune will decide
Who shall be our Bunthorne's bride!

Now tell us, we pray you,
Why thus they array you 
Oh, poet, how say you 
What is it you've done?
Of rite sacrificial,
By sentence judicial,
This seems the initial,
Then why don't you run?
They cannot have led you
To hang or behead you,
Nor may they all wed you,
Unfortunate one!
Then tell us, we pray you,
Why thus they array you 
Oh, poet, how say you 
What is it you've done?
Heart-broken at my Patience's barbarity,
By the advice of my solicitor 
In aid  in aid of a deserving charity,
I've put myself up to be raffled for!
By the advice of his solicitor,
He's put himself up to be raffled for!
Oh, horror! urged by his solicitor,
He's put himself up to be raffled for!
Oh, heaven's blessing on his solicitor!
A hideous curse on his solicitor!
Stay, we implore you,
Before our hopes are blighted;
You see before you
The men to whom you're plighted!
Stay, we implore you,
For we adore you;
To us you're plighted
To be united 
Stay, we implore you!
Your maiden hearts, ah, do not steel
To pity's eloquent appeal,
Such conduct British soldiers feel.
Sigh, sigh, all sigh!
To foeman's steel we rarely see
A British soldier bend the knee,
Yet, one and all, they kneel to ye 
Kneel, kneel, all kneel!
Our soldiers very seldom cry,
And yet  I need not tell you why 
A tear-drop dews each martial eye!
Weep, weep, all weep!
Our soldiers very seldom cry,^We soldiers very seldom cry,
And yet they need not tell us why ^And yet we need not tell you why
A tear-drop dews each martial eye!
Weep, weep, all weep!
Come, walk up, and purchase with avidity,
Overcome your diffidence and natural timidity,
Tickets for the raffle should be purchased with rapidity,
Put in half a guinea and a husband you may gain 
Such a judge of blue-and-white and other kinds of pottery 
From early Oriental down to modern terra-cottary 
Put in half a guinea  you may draw him in a lottery 
Such an opportunity may not occur again.
Such a judge of blue-and-white and other kinds of pottery 
From early Oriental down to modern terra-cottary 
Put in half a guinea  you may draw him in a lottery 
Such an opportunity may not occur again.

We've been thrown over, we're aware
But we don't care  but we don't care!
There's fish in the sea, no doubt of it,
As good as ever came out of it,
And some day we shall get our share,
So we don't care  so we don't care!
And are you going a ticket for to buy?
Most certainly I am; why shouldn't I?
Oh, Fortune, this is hard!^Blindfold your eyes;
Two minutes will decide who wins the prize!

Oh, Fortune, to my aching heart be kind;
Like us, thou art blindfolded, but not blind!
Just raise your bandage, thus, that you may see,
And give the prize, and give the prize to me!
Come, Lady Jane, I pray you draw the first!
He loves me best!
I want to know the worst!

Hold! Stay your hand!
What means this interference?
Of this bold girl I pray you make a clearance!
Away with you, away with you, and to your milk-pails go!
She wants a ticket! Take a dozen!^No!
If there be pardon in your breast
For this poor penitent,
Who, with remorseful thought opprest,
Sincerely doth repent;
If you, with one so lowly, still
Desire to be allied,
Then you may take me, if you will,
For I will be your bride!
Oh, shameless one!
Oh, bold-faced thing!
Away you run 
Go, take your wing,
You shameless one!
You bold-faced thing!
How strong is love! For many and many a week,
She's loved me fondly, and has feared to speak,
But Nature, for restraint too mighty far,
Has burst the bonds of Art  and here we are!
No, Mister Bunthorne, no  you're wrong again;
Permit me  I'll endeavour to explain!
True love must single-hearted be ^Exactly so!
From every selfish fancy free ^Exactly so!
No idle thought of gain or joy
A maiden's fancy should employ 
True love must be without alloy.^Exactly so!
Imposture to contempt must lead ^Exactly so!
Blind vanity's dissension's seed^Exactly so!
It follows, then, a maiden who
Devotes herself to loving you
Is prompted by no selfish view,
Is prompted by no selfish view!^Exactly so!
Are you resolved to wed this shameless one?
Is there no chance for any other?^None!

I hear the soft note of the echoing voice
Of an old, old love, long dead 
It whispers my sorrowing heart "rejoice" 
For the last sad tear is shed 
The pain that is all but a pleasure will change
For the pleasure that's all but pain,
And never, oh never, this heart will range
From that old, old love again!
Yes, the pain that is all but a pleasure will change
For the pleasure that's all but pain,
And never, oh never, our hearts will range
From that old, old love again!
Oh, never, oh never,^Oh, never, oh never our hearts,
our hearts will range^ Oh, never, our hearts will range
From that old, old love again!

But who is this, whose god-like grace
Proclaims he comes of noble race?
And who is this, whose manly face
Bears sorrow's interesting trace?
Yes, who is this, whose god-like grace
Proclaims he comes of noble race?
 am a broken-hearted troubadour,
Whose mind's aesthetic and whose tastes are pure!
aesthetic! He is aesthetic!
Yes, yes  I am aesthetic^And poetic!
Then, we love you!

They love him! Horror!
They love him! Horror!
They love me! Horror! Horror! Horror!
Oh, list while we a love confess^Again my cursed comeliness
That words imperfectly express.^Spreads hopeless anguish and distress!
Those shell-like ears, ah, do not close.^Thine ears, oh Fortune, do not close
To blighted love's distracting woes!^To my intolerable woes.
My shell-like ears I cannot close
To blighted love's distracting woes!

Patience

On such eyes as maidens cherish
Let thy fond adorers gaze,
Or incontinently perish,
In their all-consuming rays!

Sad is that woman's lot who, year by year,
Sees, one by one, her beauties disappear,
When Time, grown weary of her heart-drawn sighs,
Impatiently begins to "dim her eyes!"
Compelled, at last, in life's uncertain gloamings,
To wreathe her wrinkled brow with well-saved "combings",
Reduced, with rouge, lip-salve, and pearly grey,
To "make up" for lost time as best she may!
Silvered is the raven hair,
Spreading is the parting straight,
Mottled the complexion fair,
Halting is the youthful gait,
Hollow is the laughter free,
Spectacled the limpid eye,
Little will be left of me
In the coming bye and bye!
Fading is the taper waist,
Shapeless grows the shapely limb,
And although severely laced,
Spreading is the figure trim!
Stouter than I used to be,
Still more corpulent grow I 
There will be too much of me
In the coming by-and-bye!

Turn, oh, turn in this direction,
Shed, oh, shed a gentle smile,
With a glance of sad perfection,
Our poor fainting hearts beguile!
On such eyes as maidens cherish
Let thy fond adorers gaze,
Or incontinently perish,
In their all-consuming rays!

A magnet hung in a hardware shop,
And all around was a loving crop
Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,
Offering love for all their lives;
But for iron the magnet felt no whim,
Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him;
From needles and nails and knives he'd turn,
For he'd set his love on a Silver Churn!
A Silver Churn?
A Silver Churn!
His most aesthetic,
Very magnetic
Fancy took this turn 
"If I can wheedle
A knife or a needle,
Why not a Silver Churn?"
His most aesthetic,
Very magnetic
Fancy took this turn 
"If I can wheedle
A knife or a needle,
Why not a Silver Churn?"
And Iron and Steel expressed surprise,
The needles opened their well-drilled eyes,
The penknives felt "shut up", no doubt,
The scissors declared themselves "cut out",
The kettles they boiled with rage, 'tis said,
While every nail went off its head,
And hither and thither began to roam,
Till a hammer came up and drove them home.
It drove them home?
It drove them home!
While this magnetic,
Peripatetic
Lover he lived to learn,
By no endeavour
Can magnet ever
Attract a Silver Churn!
While this magnetic,
Peripatetic
Lover he lived to learn,
By no endeavour
Can magnet ever
Attract a Silver Churn!

In a doleful train
One and one I walk all day;
For I love in vain 
None so sorrowful as they
Who can only sigh and say,
Woe is me, alackaday!

Love is a plaintive song,
Sung by a suffering maid,
Telling a tale of wrong,
Telling of hope betrayed;
Tuned to each changing note,
Sorry when he is sad,
Blind to his ev'ry mote,
Merry when he is glad!
Love that no wrong can cure,
Love that is always new,
That is the love that's pure,
That is the love that's true!
Rendering good for ill,
Smiling at every frown,
Yielding your own self-will,
Laughing your tear-drops down;
Never a selfish whim,
Trouble, or pain to stir;
Everything for him,
Nothing at all for her!
Love that will aye endure,
Though the rewards be few,
That is the love that's pure,
That is the love that's true!

So go to him and say to him, with compliment ironical 
Sing "Hey to you 
Good-day to you" 
And that's what I shall say!
"Your style is much too sanctified  your cut is too canonical" 
Sing "Bah to you 
Ha! ha! to you" 
And that's what I shall say!
"I was the beau ideal of the morbid young aesthetical 
To doubt my inspiration was regarded as heretical 
Until you cut me out with your placidity emetical."
Sing "Booh to you 
Pooh, pooh to you" 
And that's what I shall say!
Sing "Booh to you 
Pooh, pooh to you" 
And that's what I shall say!
Sing "Hey to you  good-day to you" 
Sing "Bah to you  ha! ha! to you" 
Sing "Booh to you  pooh, pooh to you" 
And that's what you should/ I shall say!
I'll tell him that unless he will consent to be more jocular 
Sing "Booh to you 
Pooh, pooh to you" 
And that's what you should say!
To cut his curly hair, and stick an eyeglass in his ocular 
Sing "Bah to you 
Ha! ha! to you
And that's what you should say!
To stuff his conversation full of quibble and of quiddity,
To dine on chops and roly-poly pudding with avidity 
He'd better clear away with all convenient rapidity.
Sing "Hey to you 
Good-day to you" 
And that's what you should say!
Sing "Booh to you 
Pooh, pooh to you" 
And that's what you should say!
Sing "Hey to you  good-day to you" 
Sing "Bah to you  ha! ha! to you" 
Sing "Booh to you pooh, pooh to you" 
And that's what you should/I shall say!

It's clear that medieval art alone retains its zest,
To charm and please its devotees we've done our little best.
We're not quite sure if all we do has the Early English ring;
But, as far as we can judge, it's something like this sort of thing:
You hold yourself like this,
You hold yourself like that, 
By hook and crook you try to look both angular and flat
We venture to expect
That what we recollect,
Though but a part of true High Art, will have its due effect.
If this is not exactly right, we hope you won't upbraid;
You can't get high aesthetic tastes, like trousers, ready made.
True views on Mediaevalism Time alone will bring,
But, as far as we can judge, it's something like this sort of thing:
You hold yourself like this,
You hold yourself like that, 
By hook and crook you try to look both angular and flat
To cultivate the trim
Rigidity of limb,
You ought to get a Marionette, and form your style on him 

If Saphir I choose to marry,
I shall be fixed up for life;
Then the Colonel need not tarry,
Angela can be his wife.
In that case unprecedented,
Single I shall live and die 
I shall have to be contented
With their heartfelt sympathy!
He will have to be contented
With our heartfelt sympathy!

If on Angy I determine,
At my wedding she'll appear,
Decked in diamond and ermine.
Major then can take Saphir!
In that case unprecedented,
Single I shall live and die

When I go out of door,
Of damozels a score
(All sighing and burning,
And clinging and yearning)
Will follow me as before.
I shall, with cultured taste,
Distinguish gems from paste,
And "High diddle diddle"
Will rank as an idyll,
If I pronounce it chaste!
A most intense young man,
A soulful-eyed young man,
An ultra-poetical, super-aesthetical,
Out-of-the-way young man!
Conceive me, if you can,
An every-day young man:
A commonplace type,
With a stick and a pipe,
And a half-bred black-and-tan;
Who thinks suburban "hops"
More fun than "Monday Pops",
Who's fond of his dinner,
And doesn't get thinner
On bottled beer and chops.
A commonplace young man,
A matter-of-fact young man,
A steady and stolid-y, jolly Bank-holiday,
Every-day young man!
A Japanese young man,
A blue-and-white young man,
Francesca di Rimini, miminy, piminy,
Je-ne-sais-quoi young man!
A Chancery lane young man,
A Somerset House young man,
A very delectable, highly respectable
Threepenny-bus young man!
A pallid and thin young man,
A haggard and lank young man,
A greenery-yallery, Grosvenor Gallery,
Foot-in-the-grave young man!
A Sewell & Cross young man,
A Howell & James young man,
A pushing young particle ^"What's the next article?" 
Waterloo House young man!
Conceive me, if you can,
A crotchety, cracked young man,^A matter-of-fact young man,
An ultra-poetical, super-aesthetical,^An alphabetical, arithmetical,
Out-of-the way young man!^Everyday young man!

I'm a Waterloo House young man,
A Sewell & Cross young man,
A steady and stolid-y, jolly Bank-holiday,
Every-day young man.
We're Swears & Wells young girls,
We're Madame Louise young girls,
We're prettily pattering, cheerily chattering,
Every-day young girls.

After much debate internal,
I on Lady Jane decide,
Saphir now may take the Colonel,
Angy be the Major's bride!
In that case unprecedented,
Single I must live and die 
I shall have to be contented
With a tulip or lily!
He will have to be contented
With a tulip or lily!
In that case unprecedented
Single he/I must live and die
He will have to be contented^I shall have to be contented
with a tulip or lily!
Greatly pleased with one another,
To get married we/they decide.
Each of us/them will wed the other,
Nobody be Bunthorne's Bride!

Patience
